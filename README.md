# Unity-Vred
This is a small webserver to connect unity objects with objects in VRED.

To use this you have to do two things.

Unity:
  Import the .cs file to Unity and connect the script to the main camera object.
  Select every object you want to connect with VRED.
  Make sure you they have the same name
  
Python file
  Make sure Vred is started and all objects you want to control are there
  Tipp: You can use the python file as an .exe, so you dont have to start it with the console or an IDE.
  Start the python file.
  
  Now they should connect automatically
